**Planning response structure**

The user hasn’t asked a specific question yet but made a statement. It seems like they want me to describe or outline something. Based on the guidelines, I should provide a detailed spec for a wrapper UI, using Git as a database with REST APIs. I’ll follow the rules and keep it concise but thorough. I'll break it into sections, like architecture and UI features, and ensure the format is assertive and clear without unnecessary explanations or developer jargon. Time to get to it.
### Overview
A wrapper UI that uses Git issues and repository files as the canonical datastore and manages them exclusively through Git REST APIs. The wrapper provides a friendly, role-aware interface, enforces schemas and lifecycle rules, stores structured metadata inside issue bodies and labels, and mediates all reads and writes so Git remains the single source of truth.

---

### Key capabilities
- Treat Git issues, PRs, commits, and repo files as first-class artifacts and persist structured metadata in fenced YAML/JSON blocks inside issue bodies and selected files.  
- Use Git REST APIs for all operations: create, read, search, update, label, comment, and attach files.  
- Render role-specific forms and views by mapping fenced metadata to JSON Schema-driven UI forms.  
- Enforce lifecycle state transitions, RBAC checks, and automated guards in the wrapper before writing back to Git.  
- Maintain a fast queryable cache derived from Git events for responsive UIs while preserving Git as the authoritative data store.  
- Provide traceability visualization by building graphs from explicit metadata links and inferred links from commits/PRs/tests.  
- Generate baseline snapshots and tamper-evident export bundles for audits.

---

### Architecture
- Connector Layer: Git provider adapters that use webhooks for real-time events and REST API calls for reads/writes.  
- Parser & Validator: Extracts fenced metadata blocks, validates against versioned JSON Schemas, and normalizes artifacts into internal models.  
- Policy & RBAC Engine: Evaluates role-based visibility and write permissions, enforces transition guards and required evidence before accepting writes.  
- Metadata Cache: Document store that caches parsed objects, computed traces, and indexes for quick queries and UI rendering.  
- Write Mediator: Performs atomic, auditable updates to Git artifacts by rewriting issue bodies (single atomic edit) and appending audit comments.  
- Trace Engine: Builds directed graphs of artifacts, supports path queries, and computes coverage/health metrics.  
- UI/API Layer: Role-aware REST/GraphQL API and a single-page app offering forms, dashboards, editors, trace graphs, and export tools.  
- Baseline & Evidence Store: Snapshot generator that produces immutable baseline bundles with digests stored as issue comments and tags.

---

### Data model and storage patterns
- Canonical artifact: the Git issue (body + labels + comments) for requirements, defects, validations, and config items.  
- Structured metadata block: fenced YAML/JSON with a version field (e.g., meta-v1) containing canonical keys: id, type, status, owner, priority, trace_links, evidence_refs, custom_form, visibility, rbac_tags, baseline_id.  
- Labels: standardized label taxonomy for quick filtering and index keys (e.g., type:req, baseline:2025-10-01, cmmi:rd).  
- Derived cache: normalized documents in a DB (e.g., document store) used only for queries and UI performance; all authoritative writes flush back to Git.  
- Evidence references: stable URLs to artifacts (CI artifacts, test-run IDs, docs) and optional embedded digests or snapshot attachments in comments.

---

### Read and write patterns
- Reads:
  - Primary read uses REST API to fetch issue content and metadata when freshness required.  
  - UI reads typically hit the metadata cache for speed; cache reconciles via webhooks and periodic full-syncs.  
- Writes:
  - UI sends intended metadata update to wrapper API; wrapper validates schema and policies, composes an atomic edit that replaces only the fenced metadata block in the issue body, and writes via the Git REST API.  
  - Wrapper appends an immutable audit comment recording the change, user, timestamp, and a checksum of the previous and new metadata.  
  - Label updates and milestone changes use the Git REST API as separate atomic operations when necessary.  
- Conflict handling:
  - Wrapper rejects or flags edits if the fenced block has a concurrent external modification; wrapper provides a guided merge flow that preserves human prose and resolves metadata conflicts.

---

### Metadata block design (example)
- Use a small, explicit, versioned fenced block that is machine- and human-readable:

```yaml
---meta: v1
id: RE-101
type: requirement
title: Develop proper self-alignment
status: DRAFT
owner: team-lgm
priority: P1
visibility: internal
rbac_tags: test-leads;engineering
custom_form: LGM_ALIGNMENT_V2
trace_links:
  - type: implements
    target: GA-00001
evidence_refs:
  - type: test-run
    id: TR-2025-10-01
baseline_id: BASE-2025-10-01
---
```

- Wrapper enforces required keys and schema types.  
- Human prose and discussion remain outside the fenced block and are preserved on every write.

---

### RBAC and visibility
- Role model: Viewer, Contributor, Verifier, Approver, Admin.  
- Role enforcement: wrapper evaluates user identity from SSO/OAuth token and enforces field-level visibility and editability before attempting any Git write.  
- Visibility keys in metadata control whether fields are shown in UI and whether content is returned by the wrapper API.  
- Wrapper performs write mediation so native Git APIs are only used by the wrapper service account for controlled updates.

---

### Lifecycle, transitions, and policy engine
- Lifecycle states for requirements: Draft → Reviewed → Approved → Baselined → Implemented → Verified → Retired.  
- Transition guards: require approvals, attached evidence_refs, or closure of blocking defects before allowing certain state changes.  
- Approval flows: multi-signature approval captured as metadata approvals array and audit comments.  
- Automated transitions: triggered by external events (e.g., CI test success marks verification evidence) and mediated by policy rules.

---

### Traceability and automation
- Explicit links: recorded in trace_links inside metadata.  
- Inferred links: detected from commit messages, PR summaries, and references; flagged as "inferred" until confirmed.  
- Graph queries: path discovery, orphan detection, coverage computation, and gap highlighting.  
- Automations: auto-labeling, quality gates that prevent baselining unless coverage thresholds are met, notifications to owners for missing evidence.

---

### Baselines and audit evidence
- Baseline creation: wrapper snapshots all artifacts that match a filter, writes a baseline manifest as a repo file or issue, creates a baseline label/tag, and appends an immutable audit comment with cryptographic digest.  
- Export bundle: produces a tamper-evident bundle with artifacts, metadata manifests, digests, and a human-readable traceability matrix.  
- Audit trail: every metadata write includes an audit comment including previous and new digest hashes, actor identity, and a short change reason.

---

### Resilience, scaling, and reconciliation
- Webhooks + incremental syncs for near-real-time updates.  
- Periodic full reconciliation jobs that compare cached normalized models to actual Git content and surface discrepancies.  
- Rate-limit handling: exponential backoff for REST API calls, batched label updates, and prioritized sync queues.  
- Horizontal scaling for metadata cache and API layer to support large organizations and deep trace graphs.

---

### UI/UX patterns
- Role-specific dashboards and page layouts that surface only relevant controls and evidence panels.  
- Form-driven creation and edit flows that validate locally and server-side before committing to Git.  
- Trace graph viewer with collapsible path segments and filter controls.  
- Conflict resolution UI that shows concurrent fenced-block changes, highlights deltas, and allows guided merges.  
- Baseline builder and appraisal report generator with preview and export controls.

---

### Integration and extensibility
- Connectors: CI systems, test runners, artifact stores, SSO/IdP, and external RM/PLM systems.  
- Plugin model: custom form registry, custom policy rules, and custom trace link types.  
- API surface: wrapper REST/GraphQL for queries, writes, trace queries, baseline creation, and exports.

---

### Migration and adoption strategy
- Progressive adoption: enable wrapper for new projects and provide migration tools for legacy issues that lack fenced metadata.  
- Bulk migration: parse historical issues, generate metadata suggestions, and present reviewers with an approval flow to accept or correct inferred metadata.  
- Training and templates: provide form templates, label conventions, and onboarding checklists to project teams.

---

### Security and compliance
- Enforce SSO and least-privilege access.  
- Wrapper service uses a dedicated Git service account for writes and stores per-user audit traces in comments.  
- Immutable audit comments and baseline digests provide tamper evidence for compliance.  
- Data in cache encrypted at rest; communications to Git REST APIs use TLS and token-based auth.

---

### Example developer API calls (logical flow)
- Fetch artifact: wrapper GET /api/artifact/RE-101 returns parsed metadata + rendered form.  
- Update metadata: wrapper POST /api/artifact/RE-101 with validated patch; wrapper composes atomic edit and calls Git REST API to update the issue body, then appends audit comment.  
- Create baseline: wrapper POST /api/baseline with filters; wrapper snapshots artifacts, writes baseline manifest, creates baseline label/tag, and returns baseline_id.

---

### Operational concerns
- Logging and monitoring for webhook processing, write failures, and reconciliation errors.  
- Backups of metadata cache and baseline bundles.  
- Admin tools to repair corrupted fenced blocks and to re-run schema migrations.

---

### Summary
A Git-wrapper that uses Git REST APIs as the only datastore interface while adding structured metadata, schema enforcement, RBAC, lifecycle policy, traceability, baselining, and a role-aware UI delivers enterprise ALM/RM capabilities without abandoning Git as the canonical source. The wrapper mediates all writes, preserves human prose, appends tamper-evident audit comments, and provides a fast derived cache for UI responsiveness.
